/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the Agri-Sanchar application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for farmer profiles,
 * time-based restrictions for OTP verifications, and public read access
 * with owner-only writes for community posts and weather forecasts.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /farmer_profiles/{farmerId}: Farmer profile data, with farmerId matching the Firebase auth UID.
 * - /otp_verifications/{otpId}: OTP verification records.
 * - /community_posts/{postId}: Community posts with a farmerId field for ownership.
 * - /weather_forecasts/{city}_{date}: Weather forecast data, publicly readable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own farmer profile data (ownership).
 * - OTP verifications are time-sensitive.
 * - Community posts are publicly readable, but only the author can modify them.
 * - Weather forecasts are publicly readable.
 * - No user listing is allowed (to protect user privacy).
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Community posts denormalize the farmerId to allow for simple ownership checks.
